## 1. Target Structure Overview

### 1.1 Legal structure

- **Company**: Webbit Studio Ltd (UK private limited company).
- **Shareholders**:
  - You – Israeli tax resident.
  - Partner A – Indian tax resident.
  - Partner B – Indian tax resident.
- **Directors**:
  - At least 1 director (can be you).
  - Optionally, all three partners can be directors.

No legal requirement for a UK-resident director or shareholder.

### 1.2 Business model

- Webbit Studio provides **web development and related services** to clients mainly outside Israel and India.
- Work is done remotely from:
  - Israel (you),
  - India (partners), and
  - occasionally other countries on short trips.

### 1.3 Money and tax flow (high-level)

1. **Clients** → pay Webbit Studio Ltd (UK).
2. Webbit Studio Ltd:
   - Pays **business expenses** (hosting, tools, subcontractors, etc.).
   - Pays **service fees/salaries** to founders.
3. Remaining profit:
   - Subject to **UK corporation tax** at 19% on small profits and 25% main rate above the threshold. :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}
   - May later be distributed as **dividends** to the shareholders.
4. You and partners report income in **Israel/India** under local law.

## 2. Pre-Setup Decisions

Before you incorporate, clarify internally:

### 2.1 Share split & control

- Decide equity split (e.g. 40% / 30% / 30%, or 34% / 33% / 33% — up to you).
- Decide if all partners are both:
  - **Shareholders**, and
  - **Directors**, or if you prefer a smaller director group.

Recommendation:

- All three as shareholders.
- 1–3 directors (you + at least one Indian partner) for practical operations.

### 2.2 Roles & decision-making

Clarify:

- Who handles **sales & client relationships**?
- Who leads **technology** / architecture?
- Who is responsible for **operations and finance** (invoicing, paying suppliers, checking the accountant)?

You will put this into a **founders’ agreement** later.

### 2.3 Name & branding

- Decide on exact legal name, e.g. `Webbit Studio Ltd`.
- Check name availability in the UK (your accountant or formation agent can do this, or you can via Companies House online).

### 2.4 Accountant & formation agent

- Choose a **UK accountant** who:
  - Works with **non-UK resident founders**.
  - Understands **remote tech agencies**.
- Ideally, use a firm that offers a package:
  - Company formation.
  - Registered office & mail forwarding.
  - Annual accounts + CT600 tax returns.
  - Confirmation statement filing.

---

## 3. Incorporation – Step by Step

### Step 1 – Confirm local tax implications (Israel & India)

1. **You (Israel):**
   - Ask an Israeli CPA:
     - How to report **foreign company ownership**.
     - How to report **contractor income** or **dividends** from Webbit Studio.
     - Whether and when Israeli **CFC rules** could apply (if you end up holding a large % in a low-tax company).
2. **Indian partners:**
   - Consult an Indian CA on:
     - How to report **foreign shares** (Schedule FA, FEMA rules).
     - Taxation of **dividends / salary / contractor fees** from UK.
     - Any restrictions on **remitting money abroad** to invest in the UK company (LRS or other routes).

This is essential so there are **no surprises later**.

---

### Step 2 – Choose incorporation package

With your chosen UK accountant / formation agent:

- Select:
  - **Company type**: Private limited by shares.
  - **Registered office address**: their address, if included in the package.
  - Optional: **service address** for directors (so your home address isn’t public).

Clarify the **annual fee** for:

- Registered office.
- Confirmation statement filing.
- Accounts + CT600.

---

### Step 3 – Define share capital & shareholders

- Use simple share capital, for example:
  - 100 or 1,000 ordinary shares with equal rights.
- Allocate shares according to your agreed split:
  - Example with 100 shares:
    - You – 40 shares
    - Partner A – 30 shares
    - Partner B – 30 shares

Provide the following information to the agent:

- Full name, date of birth, address, nationality of each shareholder and director.
- % shareholding for each.

---

### Step 4 – File incorporation with Companies House

The formation agent or your accountant will submit:

- Company name.
- Registered office.
- Directors & shareholders details.
- Statement of capital.
- Standard model articles or custom articles (for most early-stage agencies, **model articles** are fine).

Once processed, you receive:

- **Certificate of Incorporation.**
- Company number.
- Company documents (memorandum, articles).

---

### Step 5 – Register for UK Corporation Tax (HMRC)

- Within a few months of starting business activities, the company must **register for Corporation Tax**.
- Your accountant typically does this and sets up:
  - HMRC account.
  - Online access for CT filings.

If you truly **do not trade at all initially**, your accountant may notify HMRC that the company is **dormant**. :contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}

---

### Step 6 – Open a business bank account / fintech account

1. Apply for a business account with:
   - A UK bank (may be harder without UK residents), or
   - A fintech such as **Wise Business, Revolut Business, etc.**
2. Provide:
   - Company documents (certificate of incorporation, articles).
   - IDs and proofs of address for all directors/shareholders.
   - Short explanation of the business (“web development services, remote clients, mainly US/EU”).

Use this account for **all client payments and company expenses**.

---

## 4. Contracts & Internal Documentation

### 4.1 Founders’ agreement

Draft a **founders’ agreement** (even simple, not perfect):

- Equity split and vesting (if any).
- Decision-making rules.
- What happens if someone leaves.
- Treatment of **IP** (code, designs belong to Webbit Studio Ltd).
- Non-compete / non-solicit boundaries (within reason and local law).

You can start with a template and later ask a lawyer to refine it.

### 4.2 IP assignment

- Make sure that **all work product** (code, designs, documentation) created by you and partners is **assigned** to Webbit Studio Ltd.
- Each founder signs a simple **IP assignment** / consultancy agreement assigning IP to the company.

### 4.3 Service agreements with each founder

Because all three of you are in different tax systems, consider:

- For **you (Israeli)**:
  - Initially, you can be treated as an **independent contractor** to the UK company:
    - Webbit pays you **service fees** (invoices from you personally or from a future Israeli company).
    - You report income in Israel.
- For **Indian partners**:
  - Similar contractor model or local Indian companies invoicing Webbit Studio.
  - Their Indian advisors will decide whether “contractor vs employee” is better locally.

Later, you can adjust to **salary or a mix of salary + dividends** depending on tax planning.

## 5. Operating the Business

### 5.1 Before you have income

If you expect **no income for some time**:

- You can keep the company **dormant**:
  - No trading transactions.
  - Only formation costs, share capital, and Companies House fees are allowed.
- You still file:
  - **Dormant accounts** once a year.
  - **Confirmation statement**. :contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}

Your accountant can handle this very cheaply.

### 5.2 When you start trading

Once you sign clients and receive money:

1. **Raise invoices** from Webbit Studio Ltd:
   - Include company name, number, registered office, and bank details.
2. Track:
   - Income by client.
   - Expenses (tools, subscriptions, contractor invoices from you and your partners).
3. Share access with your accountant (via bookkeeping software or bank feeds).

### 5.3 VAT considerations (UK)

- You only need to **register for UK VAT** once you reach the **VAT registration threshold** (which changes over time; your accountant will track it).
- Because most clients are likely outside the UK, your VAT profile may be simple, but still needs checking.

## 6. Annual Compliance Checklist (UK LTD)

Each year, your UK accountant should help you do the following:

1. **Prepare annual accounts** (micro-entity or small company format).
2. File **accounts with Companies House**. :contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}
3. File a **confirmation statement** with Companies House.
4. Prepare and file **corporation tax return (CT600)** with HMRC. :contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}
5. Pay any **corporation tax due** (if there is profit).

Even if profit is **zero** or very small, filings are still required unless HMRC accepts dormant status.

---

## 7. Personal Tax Actions (Israel & India)

### 7.1 You – Israel

Work with your Israeli CPA to:

1. Report your **ownership** in the UK company.
2. Report:
   - Contractor/consulting income from Webbit Studio (if you invoice it).
   - Any **dividends** you receive.
3. Claim **foreign tax credits** (for UK corporation tax or withholding tax) if applicable, so you don’t get double-taxed more than necessary.

### 7.2 Indian partners

They should work with Indian advisors to:

1. Ensure their **investment** in Webbit Studio complies with FEMA/LRS rules.
2. Report **foreign assets** in their Indian tax return.
3. Report:
   - Contractor income or salary from Webbit Studio.
   - Dividends they receive.
4. Check if there is any risk of India treating Webbit Studio as having a **place of effective management** in India (usually low if management is shared and not India-dominated, but advisors should confirm).

---

## 8. Practical Timeline for You

Here’s a realistic sequence you can follow:

1. **Week 1–2 – Advisors**

   - Short meeting with Israeli CPA.
   - Short meeting (video call) between each Indian partner and an Indian CA.
   - Short intro call with a UK accountant / formation agent.

2. **Week 3 – Incorporation**

   - Finalize name, share split, directors.
   - Incorporate Webbit Studio Ltd via accountant/agent.
   - Receive company number and documents.

3. **Week 4–6 – Bank & admin**

   - Open fintech or bank account.
   - Set up simple bookkeeping (e.g., Xero, QuickBooks, or even spreadsheets at first).
   - Sign founders’ agreement and IP assignment.

4. **After that – Build the business**

   - Start doing the technical work and productizing your services while:
     - Keeping the company dormant if there’s literally no activity yet, **or**
     - Recording small expenses and invoices if you start signing clients.

5. **Yearly – Compliance**
   - Your UK accountant keeps a calendar for filing deadlines so you don’t worry about UK penalties (which are much milder and more transparent than some US penalties, but still best to avoid).

---

## 9. Summary

- A **UK LTD** gives Webbit Studio:
  - International credibility,
  - Relatively low fixed costs,
  - Simple compliance even with **no profit or low income**,
  - Good support for cross-border founders (Israel + India).
- You and your partners remain responsible for **personal tax** at home, but the structure is standard and manageable with good advisors.
- The next step after these docs is to:
  - Pick a UK accountant you like, and
  - Walk through this guide with them so they can adapt it exactly to your situation.
