# Webbit Studio – Jurisdiction Comparison and UK Recommendation

## 0. Assumptions

This analysis is based on the following assumptions:

- Founders:
  - 1 founder living in Israel (Israeli tax resident).
  - 2 partners living in India (Indian tax residents).
- Business model:
  - Small remote-first web development and related services agency.
  - Most clients are outside Israel and India (US, EU, etc.).
  - Work can be done from Israel, India, the US, or other countries on short trips, but
    all founders remain tax resident in their home countries.
- Profit and distributions:
  - The company may be **inactive or low-activity for the first 6–24 months**.
  - At the beginning there may be **no income or profit** (only setup and tooling costs).
  - Founders will **not take salary** from the foreign company at the start.
  - Dividends may be taken in the future once the business is stable and profitable.
- Goals:
  1. A **reputable, English-speaking jurisdiction** that international clients trust.
  2. **Reasonable corporate tax** once the business is profitable.
  3. In the early phase, the ability to keep the company **non-trading / dormant** without
     penalties, while the technical groundwork is being built.
  4. Structure should be **legally compatible** with Israeli and Indian tax rules and
     reporting obligations, not based on hiding income or assets.

This report compares four jurisdictions:

- United Kingdom (UK LTD)
- Ireland (Irish LTD)
- Gibraltar (offshore-style UK territory)
- Dubai / UAE (Free Zone company)

and provides a recommendation and rationale at the end.

| **Ireland**               | 12.5% on trading income (headline), higher on passive / non-trading                                   | Some ability to keep the company relatively inactive, but compliance and local professional support are less “plug-and-play” than the UK for very small remote agencies | Good in tech world, but less instantly familiar than UK LTD to US small clients                                                         | Moderate–High: Irish company law and tax can be more complex and often need a local accountant from day one | Attractive rate once profitable, but overhead for a micro-agency might not justify the complexity vs UK                                                                                                       |

## 2. Jurisdiction-by-Jurisdiction Analysis

### 2.1 United Kingdom (UK LTD)

**Why people like it**

- Very common structure for small remote agencies and freelancers.
- Clients, especially in the US and EU, recognise “UK Limited” as a normal, respectable company.
- Legal documentation and guidance are available in clear English and widely documented online.
- It is possible for a brand-new company with no activity to be treated as **non-trading or dormant** for UK corporation tax purposes, so you can incorporate early and only “turn it on” for tax when the business actually starts to trade.

**Corporate tax and “no-profit” phase**

- If the company has **no trading activity and no income**, it can usually be treated as **dormant for corporation tax**.
- Dormant / non-trading companies:
  - Pay **no UK corporation tax**.
  - Generally do **not** need to submit full corporation tax returns while HMRC accepts their dormant status.
- However, a UK company – even dormant – **must still file**:
  - Annual accounts (simplified if dormant).
  - A yearly **confirmation statement** and pay the associated Companies House fee (currently around **£34 online** after the 2024 fee increase).
- These filings are straightforward but most non-UK founders prefer to pay a small local accountant or formation agent to handle them.

**Shareholders and founders**

- There is no restriction on having an **Israeli resident** and **Indian residents** as shareholders or directors.
- UK company law is mature and well-documented; adding/removing shareholders, issuing shares, and appointing directors is easy.

**Impact on founders personally (Israel and India)**

- While the UK LTD has **no income and no profit**, and:

  - pays **no salary** to founders, and
  - pays **no dividends**,

  then:

  - **There is no personal income tax** in Israel or India arising _from this company_ yet, because no one is receiving income from it.
  - However, once each founder owns shares:
    - The **Israeli founder** may need to **report the foreign shareholding** in their annual Israeli tax filings (exact forms depend on whether they are already filing a full personal return).
    - The **Indian partners** must report their shareholding in the UK company in **Schedule FA (Foreign Assets)** of their Indian tax return, even if they receive no income from it.

- In the future, once the company is profitable:
  - The UK LTD will be subject to UK corporation tax on its profits (unless HMRC considers it fully managed and controlled from another country, which is a separate structuring question).
  - **Dividends** paid to founders will be taxed in their home countries (Israel / India) under those countries’ rules and any applicable double tax treaties.
  - In Israel specifically, evolving rules on **undistributed profits and closely held companies** may, in some cases, tax certain retained profits even without dividends. This is a point to review with an Israeli tax advisor once the company starts to accumulate real profits.

**Reputation and banking**

- UK companies are widely accepted by payment processors, fintech banks, and major clients.
- Founders can typically open online business accounts (often via fintechs) rather than needing to fly to the UK.

### 2.2 Ireland

**Pros**

- Corporate tax on trading income is lower than the UK headline rate.
- Strong tech ecosystem and good reputation in the software world.
- Access to EU single market as an EU member (which can be interesting for some clients).

**Cons for Webbit Studio’s profile**

- For a very small remote agency with no physical Irish presence, Irish compliance and banking may be more complex than in the UK.
- In practice, you will often need a local accountant and possibly a registered office service from day one.
- The benefits of the lower corporate tax rate really matter only once profits are significant; in the early, almost-dormant phase, the extra friction may not be worth it.

**Impact on Israeli and Indian founders**

- Similar principle: no salary + no dividends + no profit = no immediate personal income tax in Israel/India, but reporting obligations on foreign assets still apply.
- Irish corporate tax and EU regulatory environment are more relevant for larger operations than for a tiny remote dev shop.

---

### 2.3 Gibraltar

**Pros**

- Historically marketed as a low-tax jurisdiction.
- Corporate tax rate around 10% in many cases.
- Still uses English law influences and English language.

**Cons**

- Increasingly viewed by regulators and some corporate clients as a **tax-driven / offshore** choice rather than a neutral, boring jurisdiction.
- Formation and ongoing professional services (agents, local accountants, office) are usually more expensive than a straightforward UK LTD.
- Banking can be more complicated for very small service companies, especially when all the owners live elsewhere and there is no local substance.

**Impact on Israeli and Indian founders**

- From the perspective of Israel and India:
  - Owning a Gibraltar company is **not fundamentally different** from owning a UK or Irish company. It still counts as a foreign asset which must be reported.
  - Neither country will ignore the company just because it is in Gibraltar; if anything, it can attract _more_ scrutiny.
- For Webbit Studio, Gibraltar’s offshore branding is more likely to be a reputational **negative** than a financial advantage, especially when dealing with mainstream SaaS / corporate clients.

### 2.4 Dubai / UAE Free Zone Company

**Pros**

- For certain Free Zone structures, headline **0% corporate tax** on qualifying income.
- Appealing for larger regional operations with actual presence in the UAE (office, staff, local management).
- Can be combined with UAE residency for founders who actually move there.

**Cons for Web**
